Not thinking to amuse the proud light,

The attention of the friendship of the beloved,
I'd like to introduce you
The pledge is worthier than you,
More worthy than a beautiful soul,
A saint of fulfilled dreams,
Poetry is alive and clear,

High thoughts and simplicity;
But so be it with a biased hand
Accept the collection of motley chapters,
Half-funny, half-sad,
The common people, the ideal,
The careless fruit of my amusements,
Insomnia, light inspirations,
Immature and withered years,
The mind of cold observations
And the hearts of the sorrowful will be noticed.
