Not content with one amazing trip,
some of today’s adventurers go from
challenge to challenge. Meagan McGrath from Canada has
climbed the highest mountain on each continent,
ridden a bike across Canada and run a long-distance race
in the Sahara Desert in 45ºC
heat. But perhaps her most
remarkable journey was a skiing trip to the South Pole.
On the first day, she fell into a glacier and had to be rescued.
Many of us would have given up at that point, but Meagan decided to carry
on. She reached the South Pole forty days later, having pulled
a sledge with a tent and all her food behind her through
freezing conditions and ice storms.
